## Thought process and objective
I wanted to familiarize myself with wood turning, and also wanted to create gifts for a teacher's child.
## Constraints
We had 2 weeks to create and measure the performance of various top designs, our goal was to reach at least 1 min of spin time. We also exclusively used materials found inside of the classroom. 
## Results
We created 8 tops of various sizes and shapes in order to optimize some for ease of spinning and others for endurance. 
## My contributions
I spun all the tops on the lathe successfully. I assisted in the design of the tops based on prior experience spinning the tops.
