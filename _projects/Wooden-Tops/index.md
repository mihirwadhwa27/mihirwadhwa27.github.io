## Thought Process and Objective
We wanted to learn the fundamentals of **wood turning** while creating a meaningful project. I decided to make spinning tops as gifts for a teacherâ€™s child. The project also served as an opportunity to explore how **shape, mass distribution, and surface finish** affect spin performance.
## Constraints
We had two weeks to design, manufacture, and test a series of tops using **only materials found in the classroom workshop.** Our performance goal was to achieve a minimum **spin time of one minute.**
## Results
We produced **eight tops** of varying **sizes, weights, and profiles** to test the effects of **geometry** on spin duration and ease of use. The testing phase helped **identify the balance point and shape combinations that resulted in the longest spins.**
## My Contributions
**I machined all eight tops on the wood-lathe**, ensuring conncentricity and smooth finishes. I also helped **refine the designs** using feedback from spin tests to improve both stability and endurance.
