## Motive
Our team wanted to create a hands-on project that showcased our shared passion for physics and engineering. We decided to design and build low-cost foamboard gliders using wooden dowels and 3D-printed PLA mounts. These mounts could slide along the dowel to demonstrate how shifting the center of mass and center of lift affects flight performance.
## Constraints

Budget: Under $5 per glider

Durability: Must withstand at least 20 flights before major deterioration

## Results
Each glider successfully flew up to 50 feet when launched from a height of about 10 feet. On average, the gliders lasted around 25 flights before the foamboard degraded. We presented the project at our local STEAM Symposium, demonstrating flight principles to a large group of elementary school students and using the gliders to explain center of mass and center of lift concepts in an engaging, visual way.
## My Contributions
I designed the 3D-printed wing and fin mounts and helped manufacture and assemble the gliders. The modular design made it easy to adjust the balance and aerodynamics for testing, and the presentation experience helped me improve my ability to explain engineering concepts to younger students.
