## Motive
We (group project) wanted to create a project that would allow us to showcase our passion for physics and engineering. We decided to make low cost gliders out of foamboard and dowels that were held together with PLA mounts that could slide along the dowel to demonstrate Center of Mass and Center of Lift

## Constraints
Under 5 dollars per glider
Be sturdy enough to withstand at least 20 flights before major deterioration
## Results
The gliders were able to fly around 80 ft with 10ft of elevation. We got around 25 flights before the foamboard would be unusable. We demoed the gliders at our local Steam Symposium to a large group of elementary school children and used it to teach about the Center of mass and lift.
## My contributions
I designed the 3d printed mounts for the wing and fins. I also assisted in the manufacturing and assembly of the glider.
