I am the mechanical lead for FRC 1002. As part of this, I lead a team of 30 students in the mechanical/hardware aspects of the First Robotics Competiton. I have been the mechanical lead for the past 2 years. Being part of the team has allowed me to find others who enjoy similar hobbies as me and further my skills in machining and leader ship.
## Duties
#### I am responsible for the training of my subteam. I am also responsible for the safe operation of all tools used by my members.
